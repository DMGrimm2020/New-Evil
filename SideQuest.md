 >When you travel outside of Nealion you can see down the path a 7 ft. high wooden archway with elvish wood carving on it. As you head South for 20 minutes past the wood archway you will see a grove of trees forming a perfect circle. In the center is nothing but tall green grass blowing in the wind. I'm asking that you don’t go near the center and respect my wishes. Once you are there you will be in pseudodragon territory.{.read}
