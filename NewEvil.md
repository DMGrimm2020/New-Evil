# New Evil

## Introduction
Our story takes place in the Whispering Forest, an ancient forest that over the years became smaller and smaller due too many communities rising and needing more resources. The players hear about a rumor among the land that a huge number of people have been taken by lizardfolk just outside of Whispering Forest. The players take an interest in this rumor to see if it was true just like many others have. When the players gather in Bonewood, they decide to join up with a trade caravan heading out towards the village of Nealion. The adventurers will be offered a quest to investigate these lizardfolk and see what they are up too. After which, the party will decide on whether to help the lizardfolk or let a new evil reign over the region.

(print-page)

>Greetings, have you all traveled this way to help with the Orc troubles, we would be pleased if you could get rid of them quickly. Their presence is making hunting and trading very difficult for my people.{.read}

>How much time has passed. Wild animal's dragged or something claimed the sight. Worry not adventurers as long as they no longer live I am pleased, have a seat.

 *Wait for the party to discuss it between themselves.*

 >One of my men has seen a group of two legged lizard’s gathering in one spot. I keep getting informed every couple days that their numbers keep growing. We have heard stories of lizard people capturing local’s and trader’s alike. I just don’t know for sure.{.read}
